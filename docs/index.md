# Apertium-fin-fkv

Apertium-fin-fkv is a free and open source project containing lexical resources
and some rules, primarily developed for rule-based machine translation, but
can be useful to anyone needing bi-lingual resources for the language pair.
The dictionaries and rulesets are provided in apertium's own XML format.
